\chapter{Comparison of \textit{Marta} in Polish and Esperanto}

This chapter makes an attempt to describe the contents of the Polish original of the novel \textit{Marta} and compare it with Ludwik Zamenhof's Esperanto translation.
In the process, it should be possible to identify parts of the translation where equivalence could not be achieved and try to describe the way Zamenhof dealt with these issues in the process of his translation work.
