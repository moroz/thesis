\subsection{Summary of the plot of chapter seven}

Mr. Aleksander, the cousin of Mrs. Rudzi≈Ñska, goes to the sewing parlor of Mrs. Szwejcowa to find Marta.
The visit does not go unnoticed for her coworkers and for Mrs. Szwejcowa, and prompts the latter to make further inquiries about their relationship.
She mentions that she had seen Marta the previous day in front of the Church of the Holy Cross, talking to Aleksander and Karolina, and revealing that she knew them both.
Aleksander was notorious for his machismo and had broken the heart of one of Mrs. Szwejcowa's daughters, whereas Karolina had previously worked at the same sewing parlor and had been fired for her unseemly lifestyle.
