\subsection{Summary of the plot of chapter four}

Chapter four starts at New Year's Eve.
Having worked for a month at the sewing house (?) of Mrs.\ Szwejc for a low wage, Marta is in a lot of debt, and her health has deteriorated due to extreme poverty and poor working conditions.
Passing by a bookstore, she notices a book authored by an old acquaintance, a woman.
She enters the store which she used to frequently visit during times of prosperity.
She asks the owner, an old acquaintance of her husband, whose name is not mentioned in the text, for some career advice.
In response, the owner explains that she had already exhausted nearly all possible career paths available to women.
Nevertheless, he entrusts her with the translation of a book by an unnamed French philosopher.
On the way home, Marta goes to buy a pair of shoes for her daughter.

Marta returns home with the book, but finds out that her daughter Jancia was hurt by her nanny.
Marta presents the new pair of shoes to her daughter.
Jancia goes to sleep and her mother sits down to begin work on her translation assignment, but keeps dreaming of future wealth and a prosperous life of a professional translator.
Throughout the night, she keeps reading the book, and in the morning, she starts writing down the first words of her translation.
