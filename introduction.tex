The Chinese version was translated from the Esperanto translation in May 1928 by Mr. Zhong Xianmin (錘憲民 \nazwisko{Zhōng Xiànmín}) and first published in 1930 by the Shanghai Beixin Shuju publishing house (上海北新書局 \nazwisko{Shànghǎi Běixīn Shūjú}).
(Orzeszko 1948).

All Chinese terms mentioned in this thesis are listed in Traditional Chinese characters, together with the \textit{Hanyu Pinyin} romanization (漢語拼音 \pinyin{Hànyǔ Pīnyīn}) with tone marks. Of those, the romanizations of common words is set in italic type, while proper names are set in regular font.

\section{The life and times of Eliza Orzeszkowa}

In order to fully understand the works of Eliza Orzeszkowa, it is important to put her writings in their historical context.
Poland did not exist as a sovereign state after 1795, when the remaining territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was annexed by the Russian Empire, the  Kingdom of Prussia, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
After the partitions, the ruling forces exercised policies aiming to uproot all expressions of Polish patriotism and nationalism. These policies were particularly strict in the Russian and Prussian partitions.
For 123 years between 1795 and 1918, the Polish people's struggle for independence constituted an important topic in Polish-language literature.
It was particularly important in the works of the Positivist writers, 

Eliza Orzeszkowa was born Eliza Pawłowska on June 6th, 1841, in the village of Milkowszczyzna in present-day Belarus, to a family of gentry. Her father, Benedykt Pawłowski, died when she was three years old. 
At the age of ten, she moved to Warsaw, the present-day capital of Poland, where for the following five years she attended a boarding school run by the nuns of the Order of the Holy Sacrament.
In 1858, at the age of 17, she married Piotr Orzeszko, a landowner.
The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Orzeszko proved unsuccesful, mainly due to the Eliza's passionate interest for the Polish 
(Britannica, Bachórz).

\section{Names of Eliza Orzeszkowa}

In many Slavic languages, including Polish, many family names have traditionally taken a different form when referring to a man, his unmarried daughter, and his wife.
For instance, the wife of another well-known writer, Adam Mickiewicz, was referred to as Celina Mickiewiczowa, and his eldest daughter would be referred to as Maria Mickiewiczówna, up until her marriage.
Analogously, in case of the name ``Eliza Orzeszkowa,'' Orzeszkowa means `the wife of Mr. Orzeszko,' which roughly corresponds to the English form ``Mrs. Piotr Orzeszko.''
In modern-day Polish, however, this convention is virtually obsolete.
All family members use the same form of the name, and the wife of Mr. Orzeszko can be called Mrs. Orzeszko.
A notable exception to this rule are the surnames ending in \textit{-ski} or similar suffixes, such as Kowalski, Górecki, Grodzki.
These surnames have evolved from adjectives and still follow all the grammar rules pertaining to adjectives.
Thus, the wife and daughter of the Polish counterpart of John Smith, Jan Kowalski, would still use the form \textit{Kowalska}. 

In Chinese-language literature, Eliza Orzeszkowa is referred to by her Polish name, with several, slightly different, renditions into Chinese characters.
In Zhong Xianmin's translation, her name is transcribed into Chinese as 愛麗莎・奧西斯哥 (\nazwisko{Àilìshā Àoxīsīgē}), a rather badly corrupted rendition of ``Eliza Orzeszko.''
This rendition of the name may be due to the fact that Zamenhof used the neutral form of her surname to sign his translation into Esperanto.
On Chinese-language websites, other names are used, based on the more traditional form ``Mrs. Orzeszkowa.'' These names include 艾麗查・奧熱什科娃 (\nazwisko{Àilìchá Àorèshíkēwā}) and 艾麗查・奧若什科娃 (\nazwisko{Àilìchá Àoruòshíkēwā}). In the remaining part of this thesis, the name ``Eliza Orzeszkowa'' shall be used, being the prevalent form in Polish-language writings.
