\subsection{Summary of the plot of chapter nine}

In the evening, Marta goes to beg for money in the streets of Warsaw's Old Town.
Not unlike the present day, this area of Warsaw is filled with young, wealthy, and powerful people.
Marta, not having any experience in begging, only manages to ask one man for money, who gives her 10 kopeks, much less than needed to buy firewood and medicine for Jancia.

Marta stands in front of a store, waiting for a wealthy man inside to walk out.
She asks the man for some money to buy medicine for her daughter.
``Milady,'' the man responds. ``Aren't you ashamed to beg? You are young and healthy, you can work!''

She waits for the man to pull out some money from his pocket and then steals a three-rouble bill.
The shopkeeper asks a policeman standing nearby to catch the woman who stole money from his customer.
The wealthy man merely laughs, not considering the loss to be worth such prosecution.
The policeman shouts out to the crowd that a woman clad in a black dress just stole some money.

Marta runs home, a crowd of people trying to catch her.
She sees a horse-drawn omnibus, and stands in its track.
Knowing that if she is caught, she would face prison, she decides to stand still and dies, her chest smashed by the weight of the carriage.
